Scenarios
# Helm is a templating engine
	use case - multiple microservice needs to be created which share same kind of conf
				with only few values different e.g name, image, port
				You can create a helm template with placeholders for dynamic values.
				Values are defined by yaml file or --set flag
# Same application across multiple environment e.g dev, stage, prod

install
>helm install <chart name> 
>helm install --value=my-values.yaml
>helm install --ser version=2.0.0

# Helm for release management

	Helm versions
		V2 - Helm client(cli) + Helm server(Tiller)
		Helm requests are logged. Rollback is supported
		(Seems like implementation of Gitops principle similar to Argo) 
		Tiller has to much power to CRUD K8s. So security issue.
		V3 - No Tiller. - Fixed security concern but makes helm difficult to use.
