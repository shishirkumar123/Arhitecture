https
when a server sends a public key to the browser, cant this be tempered with during transmission?



FYI - July 2018 -But now Google is going all in. Starting this month, any site with a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) address rather than a Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) address will be marked as “not secure” in the Chrome browser.

JWT

===========
JWT - Json Web Token. 
---------------------
JWT vs session

JWT are maintained at client, sessions are maintained at server.
JWT tokens allow the communication between client and server stateless hence perform better.
--------------------


JWT are of 2 types
---------------------
1. JWS - Json Web Signature - Header + Body + Signature
	- most commonly used
	- only base 64 encoded
	- not recommended to put sensitive info like credit cart number
	- anyone who steal the token can decode it, misuse it.

2. JWE - Json Web Encryption
	JWT + Encryption
