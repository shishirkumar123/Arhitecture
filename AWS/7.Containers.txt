AWS Fargate
-----------------

Why amazon came up with Fargate when it already had container service like ECS(elastic container service) and Amazon ECS for Kubernates.

Initially - (App Package + AMI) were deployed on EC2.
Then - Container on EC2.
Then - ECSs - Made it easy to manage containers and clusters. 
			But user still had to manage EC2 instances on which these clusters/containers were running.	
Then Fargate - No need of EC2 instances. Fargate is a compute engine.
			- Hosts and manages container
			- Offers seemless scaling
			- Integrated with ECS/EKS
