Route 53 - DNS service. If you have content in S3 bucket, Route 53 will provide DNS service for it.
           Provides resiliency by scaling as per the need.
           Failover is transparent to the user.

           Routing types
                      Simple
                      Failover
                      Geolocation - Will using this eliminate the need of cloudfront?
                      
CloudFront - CDN service. Speeds up content delivery If you have content in S3 bucket

           
EC2
Select EC2 based on need. Below are options -
-compute optimized, memory optimized, GPU enabled, memory optimized, general purpose.
Interesting - While creating an EC2 there is an option to request spot instances. Good to select this option when use is inteermittent. Like batch processing. It significantly reduces tco.
AMI vs docker - AMI's are VM images basically. Docker containers are packaged mini-images that run on some VM in an isolated environment.

Question
When autoscaling EC2, does it create more instances, or it adds more memory/HD etc?
