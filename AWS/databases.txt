Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for Oracle or SQL Server
==================
Managed Service: AWS RDS offers managed versions of both Oracle and SQL Server, 
taking care of administrative tasks like backups, patching, and scaling.  

Advantages: Automatic failover, automated backups, and maintenance provided by 
AWS, with minimal management from your end.

Limitations: Some customizations are restricted since AWS handles the infrastructure.

2. Amazon EC2 with Oracle or SQL Server Installed
==================================================
Full Control: Running your database on an EC2 instance gives you complete control 
  over the environment, configuration, and operating system.
Licensing: You will need to use your own licenses (BYOL), though you have the 
  freedom to customize the instance entirely.
High Availability: You’ll need to set up and manage backups, replication, and high 
  availability. Using services like EC2 Auto Recovery or Elastic Load Balancing can help manage uptime.
Advantages: Ideal if you need specific customizations that RDS doesn’t allow or if 
  you require full DBA access.

3. Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL or MySQL Compatibility (For Migration)
Alternative to Oracle or SQL Server: Aurora is a high-performance, cost-effective database offered 
  by AWS with full MySQL and PostgreSQL compatibility, designed as a managed, scalable alternative
  to commercial databases.

4.  PostgreSQL or MySQL directly on an EC2 instance in AWS.
  Benefits of Using EC2 for PostgreSQL or MySQL
Complete Control: You have unrestricted root access to both the operating system and the database.
Customization: Configure performance settings, enable custom extensions, or use tools that are not 
  supported in managed services.
Flexibility: Adjust the storage, memory, and compute capacity without limitations from a managed platform.
