S3 (object store)
An object store (not a file system).
You can store files and "folders" but can't have locks, permissions etc like you would with a traditional file system

[Other option - EFS(Elastic file system), EBS(Elastic block store - Device like C:, D: only accessible through its EC2), Glacier - long term
Note - If you provision a 100-GB EBS volume for a month, but only store 1 GB of data on that volume, you are still billed for 100 GB/m of EBS storage.
]

Create Bucket, then put objects in it. Object can be image, pdf anything.
Decide what type of S3 you need based on how frequently you need data, how quick. Make it cost effective if data is infrequently used by using storage like S3 infrequent, glacier, zone IA. else use standard frequent, standard reduced redundancy - like pdf books in library  

 
Features
Lifecycle management
	Transition action - choose to move object to another storage class
	Expiration action - delete after certain amount of time

Bucket policy - IAM policy for ARN(Amazon resource name) access control
AWS recommends that you turn on Block all public access, but before applying any of these settings, ensure that your applications will work correctly without public access.
When we create a bucket, it needs to be associated with a region. Bucket name needs to be universally unique? Once deleted, it takes time to have that same name reused. While you are waiting, it becomes available, someone else(different account) can use the name. 

Data encryption at rest and transmission
	Client side for rest
	Server side for in motion

Versioning - Unintetional edits can be rolled back

Cross-Region Replication
	Pre-requisite
	 - version enabled in both source and destination
	 - Proper role assignment

Transfer Acceleration
	e.g, 5 terrabyte to be moved from mumbai to oregon use cloud front
	
How is S3 associated in VPC? Doesn't it need compute like EC2 to sit on?
