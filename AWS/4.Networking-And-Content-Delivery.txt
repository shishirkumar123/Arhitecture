User Guide - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html
With Amazon account -
Below items are created by default-
	Multiple regions
	One vpc per region
	Multiple availability zone per Region. Subnet of same/different VPC can be inside same availability zone.
	One route table per vpc(main).
	One Security Group of type EC2-VPC.
	One internet gateway per region or per VPC? Internet gateway is needed by those VPCs only which has at least one public subnet.
	One DHCP option set per region
	One NACL per region.
	
	Note that number of regions and AZs are fixed and decided by AWS. We dont create region/AZ.
	
What is not created by default-
	NAT Gateways
	Virtual private Gateways
	Customer Gateways
=====================	
VPC
======================
----
Virtual network - By default instances within the VPCs are connected through Virtual network. We dont explicitly do anything. Try this - connection 2 instances within same subnet, across two subnet of same VPCs. The default route table(main) of a vpc shows a rule for local with the same CIDR which was specified during VPC creation. Is this referring to this virtual network?

----
VPCs
Once VPC created, one IPv4 is created what you specified during VPC creation. That becomes primary IPv4. You can't delete it.
If you delete the default VPC, you can't get it back without getting help from VPC support.
Dedicated VPCs are fast but costly.
VPC cant be deleted till it has associated instance, associated NAT Gateway, Internet gateway. 
Other things like subnet, SG, NACL, routing table gets deleted in cascade fasion.

----
Subnet

For making a subnet public -
	- Create an internet gateway and associate with subnet
	- All instances(EC2 etc) should have public or elastic IP.
	- Configure all NACL and SG rules.
----	
Route table 
	- Set of rules called routes to determine network traffic direction. (Internet traffic allowed or just local etc.). The default route table that is created when VPC is created is called 'main'. Route table and subnet relation is one to many. 
Route table can be linked to internet gateway by 2 way-
	1. Select Route table>> Edit Route >> Add Route - Destination- 0.0.0.0/0, Target igw-xxxxxx.
	2. Select Route table>> Edge Association >>Link the IGW.
What is the difference?

----
Internet Gateway
	Type of NAT(network address translation) device that uses bidirectional communication.
	Translate from a private IP address to a single Public IP address.
	Provide access into the VPC and back out to the internet, attached to VPC.
----
Egress Only Gateway
	Same as IGW but for IPv6
	Doesn't allow traffic back-in
	By default every IPv6 is publicly routable so there is not choice for public and private subnet.
	Note: Terms - Egress-Outbound, Ingress-Inbound.
----
DHCP Option sets
	One DHCP option set already exist in the region.
	All the VPC in the region use same DHCP. While creating VPC, the choice was not even asked. 
	
----
Elastic IP addresses - Static, charge associated. 
-----
VPC endpoint - Allows you to securely connect your VPC to another service like S3, DynamoDB.
------------
VPC Endpoint Service 
	You can use PrivateLink technology to make services in your VPC available to other AWS accounts and services.
	PrivateLink is a highly available, scalable technology that enables private access to services.
	Other accounts and services can create an interface endpoint to access your endpoint service
----
NAT device - Used by instances of private subnet to access internet. Outside world still cant access these instances.
	Only have one IP address.
	2 types - NAT Gateway(recommended, managed) and NAT instance. NAT gateway hours are charged based on usage and amount of data processed.
	Once NAT gateway is created, one network interface is also created. This can be viewed from EC2 >> Network and Security >> Network Interface. 
	Seems like Elastic IP address is automatically created and associated with NAT gateway when a NAT gateway is created. Verify.
	NAT gateway itself recide in public subnet.
	Can't be associated by NACL, only with SG.
	Aren't highly available, should have a NAT gateway in each AZ.
	Automatically scale with loads.
	
	Charges - April 2020
	$0.045 per GB Data Processed by NAT Gateways
	$0.045 per NAT Gateway Hour(Roughly $1 a day)
----
Peering connections - VPC connecting to another VPC.
	Can be done withing the same account and different account. 
	Can be done in same region or different region.
	
	VPC Peering (Point to Point) is not transitive.
	AWS Transit Gateway (hub-and-spoke )- Added later, better alternative to VPC Peering. It connects all VPCs.
	You can attach up to 5000 VPCs to each gateway and each attachment can handle up to 50 Gbits/second of bursty traffic-2018
----	
Security group - Associated with a VPC. Act as a firewall that controlls the traffic for one or more instances by adding rules to SG. Examples -
	SG for web server typically allows only port 80(HTTP), 443(HTTPS) traffic. May be add SSH at 22 to manage it.
	SG for database server may allow only port 1433(MS SQL), 3389(RDP).
It is recommended to create different SGs for different layers.
Default inbound rule - none (Nothing allowed)
Default ourbound rule -all (Everything allowed)

When a VPC is created, a default SG is created which is associated with VPC. Till this time there is no subnet. That means there is no compute. So SG rules are not applied to anything. But when subnets are added and then EC2, Fargate etc are added on the subnet, and no other SG is added, does the VPC level rules apply to all the instances of all the subnets?
----	
NACLs - You might setup network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add additional layer of security to your VPCs. For every subnet, an ACL is a must. A default NACL is created, when a subnet is created. NACL to subnet relation is one to many. Unlike SG, ACL is stateless.
	NACL applies at subnet level, SG applies at instance level.
	When traffic enters your network, it is filtered by NACLs before it is filtered by security groups.
----
Amazon recommends SG for whitelisting and ACL for blacklisting. Additionally use WAF for vulnarabilities.
Note that allow/deny option against rules is available is NACL only. Not available in SG. Because SG rules are whitelisting.
----
Virtual Private Gateway - used for making VPN connection. VPN connections costs money depending on usage and amount of data transfer.
----

VCP limits - 200 subnets, 200 route tables, 500 SG, 50 inbound+outbound rules - per VPC.
5 VPC per region.
=====================
API Gateway
=====================
Four types-
HTTP API- low-latency and cost-effective REST APIs with built-in features such as OIDC and OAuth2, and native CORS support.
WebSocket API- Build a WebSocket API using persistent connections for real-time use cases such as chat applications or dashboards.
REST API- Develop a REST API where you gain complete control over the request and response along with API management capabilities.
REST API Private - Create a REST API that is only accessible from within a VPC.
-----------
===================
Route 53 
===================
	- DNS service. If you have content in S3 bucket, Route 53 will provide DNS service for it.
           Provides resiliency by scaling as per the need.
           Failover is transparent to the user.

        - Routing types
                      Simple - e.g Route a a simple website.
                      Failover - e.g If connection fails to s3 bicket as a website then route to a complex tree of records.
                      Geolocation - e.g Based on country(I18n). In US it can be done based on states also. 
                                           Will using this eliminate the need of cloudfront?
                      Geoproximity - Based on location of resource.
                      Latency Based - Serves from Region which provides lowest latency.
                      Multivalue Answer .
                      Waited.
Price (April 13th 2020) $0.50 per Hosted Zone for the first 25 Hosted Zones.  I notice that $0.50 is per month charge.                                   
Can be integrated with IAM.

 Question
 1. While creating VPC, we specify IPv4 CIDR block. If we put 10.0.0.1/24, it will generate 256 IP addresses. What if I just want 50 IP address.
 2. How do I decide between regional replication and zonal replication for various resources like s3, dynamodb?
 A. S3 is at regioanl level.
 
 3.EC2/Fargate instance can crash, ECS can rebuild a new instance. What if a subnet/AZ crash, or a VPC crash? Who will recreate it?
 
 4. In the same AWS account can I create 2 VPCs with same CIDR - 10.100.0.0/16 and again 10.100.0.0/16? Consider VPC in same region, different region.
 
 5. After configuring the network, can I export it.
 6. How VPC flowlog is different from cloudwatch?
 
 7. There was a default VPC in Oregon region with IPv4/CIDR 171.31.0.0/16. Can I create a new VPC in same region with same IPv4/CIDR?
 A. Yes. But I think it can create problem during peering between them. Verify.

 8. Can you create more than one internet gateway withing one VPC?
 A. No. When attaching an igw to a vpc, only those vpc appears in the drop down which doesnt have an igw attached. 
 
 9. Route table per region, per vpc or per AZ/subnet?
 10. If AZ and subnet is 1 to 1 mapped why there was a need for these two construct? Cant they be clubbed as one?
 11. Can a subnet be associated with more than 1 route table? Vice versa?
 12. For VPC, when to enable/disable DNS resolution?
 13. A VPN's IPv4 CIDR is 10.0.0.0/24. Its subnet 1 is 10.0.0.0/28, subnet 2 is 10.0.0.32/28. How many available IPv4 in both subnets? Console show 11. How?
 14. Why NACL sources are 0.0.0.0/0 but SG sources are security group id?
 15. There is no provision of creating more than one IPv4 CIDR for a user created VPC. Buth there are two CIDR for the default VPC. Why?
 16. If I associated an IGW to a subnet making it public, but in the associated NACL, I denied all inbound traffic, will this subnet be a public subnet?
 17. When does it makes sense to create our own DHCP? 
 18. If I create more DHCP option set, how to change DHCP option set of a VPC?
 19. Verify two EC2 instances in 2 different subnet of same VPC are able to communicate.
