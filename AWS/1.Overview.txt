Route 53 - DNS service.      
CloudFront - CDN service. Speeds up content delivery If you have content in S3 bucket
============================================
Compute
============================================
-------
EC2
Select EC2 based on need. Below are options -
-compute optimized, memory optimized, GPU enabled, general purpose.
------
Outpost 
- AWS Outposts brings native AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models to virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility. When you have applications that needs to be run on-prem and you need to communicate from your new application running on AWS cloud, this is very useful feature making your overall solution a hybrid approach.

-Unlike other hybrid solutions that require use of different APIs, manual software updates, and purchase of third-party hardware and support, Outposts provide a truly consistent developer and IT operations experience across on premises and cloud environments.

-Payment term is 3 years. cost $700 to $30000 per month depending on requirement - As of April 2020.
           1 m5.24xlarge, 11+ TB EBS ---> $7,196.96/month (General purpose)
           5 c5.24xlarge, 11+ TB EBS  ---> $13,733.38/month (Compute optimized)
           11 c5.24xlarge, 11+TB EBS  ---> $28,633.71/month (memory optimized)
           4 m5.24xlarge, 2 g4dn.12xlarge, 11+ TB EBS --->$18,735.61/month (Graphic optimized)
-------
LightSail

- Provides compute, storage, networking capacity and capabilities to deploy and manage website and web application in the cloud.
- Includes everything you need to quickly launch your project - A VM, SSD based storage, data transfer, DNS management and an static IP.

-------
AWS Batch
- AWS Batch enables you to easily and efficiently run batch computing workloads of any scale on AWS using Amazon EC2 and Amazon EC2 Spot.

-------
Elastic Beanstalk
- With Elastic Beanstalk, you can deploy, monitor, and scale an application quickly and easily.
-------
Cloud formation - AWS infrastructure provisioning. You can use non AW Ssolution like Terraform which works with other cloud providers too.

ELB - Elastic Load Balancer - for load balancing
=================
Questions
1. Can route 53 be used as Load balancer?


============================
Container Services
============================
AWS Fargate
---------------

Why amazon came up with Fargate when it already had container service like ECS(elastic container service) and Amazon ECS for Kubernates.

Initially - (App Package + AMI) were deployed on EC2.
Then - Container on EC2.
Then - ECSs - Made it easy to manage containers and clusters. 
			But user still had to manage EC2 instances on which these clusters/containers were running.	
Then Fargate - No need of EC2 instances. Fargate is a compute engine.
			- Hosts and manages container
			- Offers seemless scaling
			- Integrated with ECS/EKS
			
-------------------------

ECS - Elastic container Service - something like K8s
ECS has
    - Control Plane - For scheduling and orchestration
    - Managing Services - Managing the lifecycle of a container
            - EC2 instances having docker(or any container) runtime 
            -ECS Agent for communication with control plane


	Can ECS cluster go beyond a region/vpc?
	Cluster, Services, Tasks

ECS setup options
     -ECS with EC2 - Create EC2 and join them to ECS cluster. 
             In this setup, you have to manage infrastructure yourself. You have to-
                - Manage operating system
                - Docker runtime, ECS Agent
                - check whether enough resources
                Advantage - more control of infrastructure
     -ECS with Fargate  - delegate infrastructure management also to AWS. AWS will do
                - container orchestration
                - Hosting infrastructure management
            You provide containers to fargate. Farget will decide hou much RAM, CPU, other resources will be required.
            So procisioning will be taken care of, on demand. So pay only what you use.
            Compare this with EC2 where you have to pay for having an EC2 irrespective of using or not.
            BUT - you loose control.
-------------------------------
EKS - Elastic K8s service - Alternative to ECS
Why EKS
     Because project was already using k8s and want to move to aws as is
     k8s is open source 
     K8s vendor neutral. ECS is Amazon specific

Cloudwatch - For monitoring
