With Amazon account -
Below items are created by default-
	Multiple regions
	One vpc per region
	Multiple availability zone per VPC. One subnets per availability zone?
	One route table per region - confirm. Route table may be associated to subnet.
	One internet gateway per region or per VPC? Internet gateway is needed by those VPCs only which has at least one public subnet.
	One DHCP option set per region
	One NACL per region
	
What is not created by default-
	NAT Gateways
	Virtual private Gateways
	Customer Gateways

VPC endpoint - Helps connect other service like S3 to VPC.
VPC Endpoint Service - Helps connect to other account.

Once VPC created, one IPv4 is created what you specified during VPC creation. That becomes primary IPv4. You can't delete it.

VPC Peering - Can be done only between VPCs of same region. Peering is not transitive.
  
 
 Question
 1. While creating VPC, we specify IPv4 CIDR block. If we put 10.0.0.1/24, it will generate 256 IP addresses. What if I just want 50 IP address.
 2. How do I decide between regional replication and zonal replication for various resources like s3, dynamodb?
 A. S3 is at regioanl level.
 
 3.EC2/Farget instance can crash, ECS can rebuild a new instance. What if a subnet/AZ crash, or a VPC crash? Who will recreate it?
 
 4. In the same AWS account can I create 2 VPCs with same CIDR - 10.100.0.0/16 and again 10.100.0.0/16? Consider VPC in same region, different region.
 
 5. After configuring the network, can I export it.
 6. How VPC flowlog is different from cloudwatch?
 
 7. There was a default VPC in Oregon region with IPv4/CIDR 171.31.0.0/16. Can I create a new VPC in same region with same IPv4/CIDR?
 A. Yes. But I think it can create problem during peering between them. Verify.
