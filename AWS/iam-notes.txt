Once AWS account is created, the account id has root access. By default mutilple regions are assigned to the account. All active by default. 
	Its Better to deactivate the regions that you wont be using. 
	Its better to create a user with limited access and use this new user most of the time.
	Enabling a region is free, but your users might create or use resources that result in AWS fees.
	
What is the default user? What roles are associated with it?

What else is created by default-
	Multiple regions
	One vpc per region
	Multiple subnets per region
	One route table per region
	One internet gateway per region
	One DHCP option set per region
	One NACL per region
	
What is not created by default-
	NAT Gateways
	Virtual private Gateways
	Customer Gateways
	
When we create various resources like EC2 instances, ECS clusters with tasks, new roles are created. All roles are associated with predefined policies. Are these roles getting associated with my default root users too?

Group have policies.
User Belong to Group. User has policies independent of Group. User with Programatic access will have keys. User with just console wont.


Billing is at global level. There is no region wise billing.
