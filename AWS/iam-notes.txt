	Its Better to deactivate the regions that you wont be using. 
	Its better to create a user with limited access and use this new user most of the time.
	Enabling a region is free, but your users might create or use resources that result in AWS fees.

User Belong to Group. User has policies independent of Group. User with Programatic access will have keys. User with just console wont.
