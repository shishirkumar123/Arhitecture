Load balancing.
Advantage -
  Spread load across multiple downstream
  Expose a single point of access(DNS) to your application
  Seemlessly handle the failure of downstream instances
  Regular health checks.
  High availability across zones.

Architectures:
1. Pblic ALB received all request. Public ALB sends request to private ALB. Private ALB distributes request to EC2. 
  What is the advantage of having public/private ALB?


Assignment
1. Running ReactJS on multi EC2. Put a load balancer in front.
2. Restrict HTTP request to EX2 only from load balancer.
3. Allow load balancer to accept HTTP request from anywhere.
