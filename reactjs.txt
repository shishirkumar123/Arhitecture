Ok to proceed? (y)
>cd my-app
>npm start

1. rfce for skeleton with function
2. rce for skeleton with class
3. rconst for constructor
4. rpce for pure component

Four approaches for event binding
1. Binding in render -                   this.<handler>.bind(this)                          - Performace issue
2. Binding in render using '=>' -        {() => this.<handler>}
3. Binding in class constructor -        this.<handler> = this.<handler>.bind(this)	    - recommended
4. class property as '=>' function	<handler> = () => {...}                             - this is also okay

Styling react component

export default explanation -



Simplest Understanding for default export is

Export is ES6's feature which is used to Export a module(file) and use it in some other module(file).

Default Export:

default export is the convention if you want to export only one object(variable, function, class) from the file(module).
There could be only one default export per file, but not restricted to only one export(Named export).
When importing default exported object we can rename it as well.
Export or Named Export:

It is used to export the object(variable, function, class) with the same name.

It is used to export multiple objects from one file.

It cannot be renamed when importing in another file, it must have the same name that was used to export it, but we can create its alias by using as operator.

In React, Vue and many other frameworks the Export is mostly used to export reusable components to make modular based applications.
