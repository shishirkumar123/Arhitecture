Core Concepts
--------------
Tables, Items, Attributes and Indexes.
Tables are collection of items.
	Create table 
		- Specify partition key(=Hash Key), sort key(=range key). Can't change lateron(Remember trade off)
		- Which partition the data will go? It is determined by hash of partition key.
		- If you have a key that can be unique, make that partition key. 
			Then you dont need sort key.
		
Items are collection of attributes or key vaue pair.
