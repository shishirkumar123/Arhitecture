//While using code editor this the following -
1. At Window desired folder, right click open bash and do git clone <git-repo>.
    - entire folder is downloaded.
2. At code editor, in the source control tab - stage, commit, push.
    - This prompts for user id/password for github. Hope that if it was supplied before git config, the prompt might not have come.

Notes
1. I guess it is better to do git pull before git push. If file 1 got modified directly in the repo, file 2 was 
modified locally, when you try git push, you get error. So first pull and then push.
