In restful service we have @RestController, @Service, @Repository. Service is injected in controller, 
repository is injected in service, so these objects are created by spring container and injected. 
Who creates object of rest controller? Are they created by servlet container and translated into a servlet?
Where is the Dispatcher/Router? How many object of rest controller is created. If single instance(like traditional servlet), 
then what happens if so many request comes?
Each request becomes a thread. How many threads can be supported?

With typical Controller, Service, Repository I noticed below -
Till I didnot annotate controller with @RestController, I could @Autowire Service.
But when I added @RestController, I had to put @Component at Service class. Why?

12/28/2021 - When I am using  @RestController, @Service, @Repository, dont need anything else like @Bean/@component/@Autowire

@PathVariable(org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable) 
vs
@javax.websocket.server.PathParam
