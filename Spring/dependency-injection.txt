Explicitly call ApplicationContext.getBean(<class-name>.class)
if<class-name> is not annotated with @component(or@controller/@service/@repository), getBean will not work.
@Autowiring also has same requirement as getBean. @Qualifier(confirm this) is used with autowire for name.
@Autowiring can be used at class member, method or constructor?

By default singleton scope. Can be prototype. If singleton, object is created during spring container initialization.
If prototype, object is created when it is needed.

@Bean old style(compare with @Component). @Bean is a method annotation, in the method we create object specifing new. 
@component is class annotation.

---------------
@Autowire vs @Component
@Autowired is used for injecting dependencies, while @Component is used to define a bean.
@Component tells Spring to manage the lifecycle of a class, whereas @Autowired tells Spring to resolve and inject a dependency automatically.
In short, @Component is about bean creation, and @Autowired is about bean injection.
