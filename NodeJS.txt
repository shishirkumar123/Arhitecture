NodeJS
===========
#01:
	# Single threaded, event driven, non-blocking
	# Good for building fast and scalable data intensive application
	# Not good for heavy processing like image processing, file compression, video compression. (PHP, Python better alternative)

#02:
	# Use even version number of node for prod use
--------
#03
	On windows, Use cmd or use [VSCode and go to terminal] 
	>node
        >2+5

	# Underscore is special veriable which store value of previous expression
