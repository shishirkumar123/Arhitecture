===========
#01:
	# Single threaded, event driven, non-blocking
	# Good for building fast and scalable data intensive application
	# Not good for heavy processing like image processing, file compression, video compression. (PHP, Python better alternative)
----------
#02:
	# Use even version number of node for prod use
--------
#03
	On windows, Use cmd or use [VSCode and go to terminal] 
	>node
        >2+5
	>_ 
	>_ -1 
	# Underscore is special veriable which store value of previous expression
	REPL - Read(user input) Evaluate(user input) Print (or output the result) Loop (Return and wait for new input)
        >let person = {name: "Shishir", age: 16}
	>person.name
