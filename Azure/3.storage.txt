Components of Azure Storage
-----------------------------
Blobs - To store unstructured data like media files, application installer. Equivalent to AWS S3.
        These items then can be accessed if permissions are granted.
        Folders inside the blobs are called containers.
        Container Types - Private, Blob, Container(like folder inside folder) 
        Q. What happens if a file with same name uploaded. 
        A. No clash. Sytem generates unique name.
Queues - Single queue can have up to 64 kb size message. Queue can contain millions of messages, 
        up to total capacity of storage account. Jobs can be put on Queue and executed later(like SQL)
        Excersise - Create a web page to send message to Azure queue. Send message. Do some processing
            and remove it from queue.
File Systems - Create file system in azure and mount it on your computer/ VM on cloud.(Use it as a drive).(Windows 10 and above) 
        A file storage share is an SMB file share in Azure. 
        All directories and files must be stored in a parent share.
        An accont can contain unlimited number of shares.
        A share can contain unlimited number of files up to the 5TB total capacity of file share.

Tables - Azure table storage service stores large amount of unstructured data. (Mini NoSQL)
        Ideal for storing structured non relational data. Non relational solution makes it easy to add additional attributes.
