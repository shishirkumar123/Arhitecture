Read the theory about the hieararchy:

Management Groups - By default, 1 MG was there Tenant Root Group. It wasnt visible from anywhere. When I searched for MG, the MG page opened up, showing message start creating MG. I created 1st MG. Then I saw the hierarchy. This new MG was created the MG called Tenant Root Group. Max 10,000 MG in a single directory

  - Subscriptions - By default, 1 Scubcription was created inside MG - Azure subscription 1.
    -Resource Groups
      -Resources

Microsoft Entra ID [Azure AD is now Microsoft Entra ID]- 
Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management service that your employees can use to access external resources. Example resources include Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications.

Relationship of Entra ID with subscription -  
All Azure subscriptions have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. Subscriptions rely on this tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. When a subscription expires, the trusted instance remains, but the security principals lose access to Azure resources. Subscriptions can only trust a single directory while one Microsoft Entra tenant may be trusted by multiple subscriptions.

On portal.azure.com, in my profile, I see :
  - a default directory is created with the name 'Default Directory'
  - a domain with the name 'shishirkumar123gmail.onmicrosoft.com'
  - a directory with id 20365eaf-7843-45ba-8671-6b5f3e7f5b9c

Tenant: A tenant is a dedicated and isolated instance of the Azure Active Directory
Directory: A directory is a container for objects such as users, groups, and applications, and is used to manage access to resources in Azure.

Tenant and Directory has many to many relationship.

In Azure, a domain is used to verify ownership of a custom domain name and to create user names and email addresses for users in a tenant. 

Tenant and Directory has many to many relationship.

All subscriptions within a single management group must trust the same Entra ID tenant.
