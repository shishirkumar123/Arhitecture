Azure Virtual machine is a emulation of computer system. Equivalent of AWS EC2.
Virtual network - communication channel between resources in the cloud. Azure VNet represents your own network isolated with rest.
Virtual network components
    Subnet - public(internet accessible), private
    Network security group - like a firewall for your network. 
        All the traffic coming to a subnet shoud first pass its respective NSG.

Excersize
    1. Create NSG - 1 for web, 1 for database.
    2. Create Virtual Network 
    3. Create subnet inside this Virtual Network 2 subnets. 1 subnet accociate with web NSG, another attach to database NSG.
    3. Create Web Server VM and Database VM.
        Q. Are we buying VMs on hourly or 1 time purchase. What are the rates for each option?
    4. Configure NSG for respective VMs. For each VM, set rule for HTTP and HTTPS.
        If your VM is ubuntu based try connectting through putty. Wont connect. Need to enable SSH by ading rule to NSG.

        on web server -

            $mysql -u root -p
            -------
            Create database -
            mysql>create user 'shishir'@'localhost' identified by 'something'
            mysql>grant all privileges on *.* to 'shishir'@'localhost' with grant option;
            mysql>grant all privileges on *.* to 'shishir'@'%' with grant option;
            ------------
            Connect to database -
            $mysql -u shishir -p
            $cd /etc/mysql
            $sudo nano my.cnf
                comment out the property bind-address

        From local computer, using mysql client connect to database server -
            >mysql -h <ip address> -u <user> -P <port> -p [wont connect, restart service - $sudo service mysql restart]. Now  connect.
            mysql> create database <dbname>
            mysql>create table ...
