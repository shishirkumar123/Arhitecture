Azure
------------------
Compute domain
	Virtual machine - specify RAM and HD requirement and get your computer.
	App Service - automated version, used to deploy an application. This is with limited abilities. 
				Doesn't give user interface. simple and quick to setup. don't need to configure firewall etc.
	Function - SErverless. Just upload the code and execute.
	
Blob storage
	Blob storage - store any type of file
	Queue storage - used for queueing task that can be read sequentially and thus used for synchronization.
	Backup - store infrequently used data at a minimum price. retrieval will be slow.

Scaling - 2 types horizontal - increase the number of server, vertical add more h/w RAM etc to the same m/c. 
Autoscaling - Scale up/ down number of servers as per need. In azure, need to set rules for auto increase/decrease. 
             [Use operator less than/greater than]
Loadbalancer - balance load across servers. While using auto-scaling, azure automatically attach a load balancer.


TODO
----------

Before azure account
1. Install mysql, create database, table.
2. Install Filezilla

As of Jan 21st, 2020, you can get azure account free for one year. Remember all services are not free. So free account doesnt
give you access to every ervice. You get $200 credit to be used but that will expire within a month.

Once you get a azure account try to do the following -
1. Kepp a web-app(e.g php) ready for deployment. Create an app server on azure and deploy the web app.
2. Try autoscaling. Increase/Decrease and see matrics change.
