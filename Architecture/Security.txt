Authentication architecture
1. Custom security architecture - Monolith web apps - eOffice, eCourts
	Diagram 1
	Identity
	Authentication
	Authorization
	Identity Provisioning - Create roles, user, password rotation etc.
	
	Login starts session, logout destroys session/cockie
	
	Problems
	- Enterprise has 100 apps. 1 employee uses many of them.
	 Diagram 2
	- Use identity is duplicated
	- user has to remember many usedid/pwd
	- Provisioning/deprovisioning user complicated
	- SSO cant be implemented
	- MFA difficult to implement. Application is responsible for it.
	- credential are sent to application(security issue)
	
2. Common identity - LDAP - Microsoft AD, Novell DS
	Diagram 3
	It will store:
	First Name
	Last Name
	Email
	Phone
	Picture
	Manager
	Department Identity
	Groups associated with user
	
	Manage User
	Reset Password
	
	Directory service
	Diagram 4: 
		dc - domain component, 
		ou - org unit. one ou can be inside another ou. 
		cn - common name
	- User, groups stored in tree structure
	- Fast retrival and serach
	
	LDAP v3
	- Protocol to access Directory Service
	- Vendor neutral
	- All major language have an implementation
	
	Provisioning of a user is now responsibility of IDP
	Change in responsibility:
	Diagram 7
	Provisioning/deprovisioning became simpler
	
	Problems:
	User still sending id/pwd through the application to IDP
		transmission is SSL/TLS enabled but	id/pwd is accessed by we apps. 
		developers can log this for debug and forget. security violation. 
	It is still not SSO. Multiple times enter id/pwd.
	Appn and LDAP server must be in the same security domain. Not possible in cloud scenario:
		Diagram 8, 9
	Appn responsible for MFA.
	
3. Delegated authentication
	Diagram 10
	
	Now Web app, IDM need not be in same security domain.
	Need to built trust between IDM and Webapp. Each have set of public private key.
