graphql 

alternative to REST
With rest, sometime we get too much info, sometime we get too less.
e.g too much - needed 5 fields but got 50 fields
e.g to less - needed object and nested objects. 
	in REST we first get one object, then pick value of one field and make another REST call.
graph ql provides the consumer of API better alternative.

Specification
Graph QL has
1. TypeDefs - to define schema of the data
			- can be as simple as an entity with few fields
			- can form complex structures stablishing relationships between entity.
2. Resolver - the source of data. Can have a local simple json file 
				or can be any endpoint returning data. Has to be json?


Consumer can query by
1. Specifing which specific columns are needed 
2. Specifing which specific row(s) is/are needed





Consumer can mutate the data as well. (Then why it is called GraphQL - it is not just a query language?)

Graph QL specification provided by - 
Implemented by many like Apollo, Srinivas used some other - check his code

This example is based on Apollo.

Queries for Srinivas
# In LCAP we define aggregate having multiple entities
In Graph QL, is it assumed that the entry point to the graph is aggregate from where entities can be navigated?
Or can we start from entities as well and navigate to aggregate?

This will affect the generated code - index.ts.
