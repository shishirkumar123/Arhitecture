General network concepts
=============================
switch - connects devices in LAN.
router(gateway) - connects two networks. e.g Your home network will connect to internet through router.
	router has 2 ip address. one on LAN, anothr on WAN.
hub - A hub works on the physical layer (Layer 1) of OSI model while Switch works on the data link layer (Layer 2). 
	Switch is more efficient than the hub. A switch can join multiple computers within one LAN.
	Hub just connects multiple Ethernet devices together as a single segment.
Subnet mask - not an ip address. Indicates LAN range.
	Example. If IP address of device A is 192.168.10.11, subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, LAN range starts from 192.168.10.0 to 192.168.10.255. 
	This is how device A knows that if it needs to communicate to perticular IP address, will it find in LAN, or need to talk to router.
	
	
IP address
		Private
			Class A - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 - 16,777,216 IP addresses
			Class B - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 -  1,048,576 IP addresses
			Class C - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 - 65,536 IP addresses
			
			classless with subnetting(CIDR)
		Public


===================================================

hub
	- has many port like switch
	- not intelligent. doesnt have h/w mac table
	- like beater
	- 1 collision domain. - 2 device communicating. 3rd try to coomunicate with 1 of them, corrupts communication between 1 and 2
	- 1 broadcast domain. - sending to all device
	
bridge - more intelligent that hub, less than switch.

switch
	- knows mac address of all devie connected.
	- helpts P2P communication rather that broadcast.
	- no of collition domain = no of device ports.
	- has CAM table

Router
	- intelligent.  many collition and broadcast domain.
	
2 address - IP layer 3, mac address layer 2.
Local communication
Data transmission using ethernet happens only using mac address.
ARP =Address reoltion protocol(broadcast). Device 1 sends ARP (with MAC )to switch. Received by everyone, Device 2 responds. 
Now device 1 knows IP address of Devie 2 and starts communication through switch.

External communication
Needs gateway(Router). Works at layer 3.(IP). Has routing table. packet goes through multiple router before reaching to destination.

Cisco switch doesn't have a power input, router has.
