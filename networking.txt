General network concepts
=============================
switch - connects devices in LAN.
router(gateway) - connects two networks. e.g Your home network will connect to internet through router.
	router has 2 ip address. one on LAN, anothr on WAN.
hub - A hub works on the physical layer (Layer 1) of OSI model while Switch works on the data link layer (Layer 2). 
	Switch is more efficient than the hub. A switch can join multiple computers within one LAN.
	Hub just connects multiple Ethernet devices together as a single segment.
Subnet mask - not an ip address. Indicates LAN range.
	Example. If IP address of device A is 192.168.10.11, subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, LAN range starts from 192.168.10.0 to 192.168.10.255. 
	This is how device A knows that if it needs to communicate to perticular IP address, will it find in LAN, or need to talk to router.
	
	
IP address
		Private
			Class A - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 - 16,777,216 IP addresses
			Class B - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 -  1,048,576 IP addresses
			Class C - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 - 65,536 IP addresses
			
			classless with subnetting(CIDR)
