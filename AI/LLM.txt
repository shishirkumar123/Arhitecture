Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems designed
to understand the intricacies of human language and to generate
intelligent, creative responses when queried. It is trained on enormous 
data sets typically measured in petabytes

LLMs can be utilized alongside generative AI models to improve content 
translation and localization. A large language model can decipher the 
nuances of language, while generative AI can create accurate translations 
and localized versions of the content.

A key breakthrough came in 2017 when the Google Brain
team introduced the transformer architecture, a deep learning model
that replaced traditional recurrent and convolutional structures
with a new type of architecture thatâ€™s particularly effective at
understanding and contextualizing language, as well as generating
text, images, audio, and computer code. 
LLMs based on the transformer architecture have enabled new
realms of AI capabilities. - eg. ChatGPT - Chatbot Generative Pretrained 
Transformer. Transformers use GPUs for faster training of AI models.

Thousands of opensource models are available on public sites such as 
GitHub and Hugging Face. Developers can use the pretrained AI models as a
foundation for creating custom AI apps.
