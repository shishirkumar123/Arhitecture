Deep learning is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses 
neural networks to teach computers to process data in a way that 
mimics the human brain. Neural networks are the fundamental technology 
in deep learning, and are made up of interconnected nodes, or neurons, 
in a layered structure

Neurons in layers. 
Each layer neurons connected with other layer neurons, but not with each other.
Each neuron decides whether to send singnal to the layer further. (is signal strong enough)
Input layer - Entry layer 
Output layer - Last layer. 
			Output layer may have multiple neurons showing probability of each output.
Hidden Layer - All intermediate layers
Info pass starting from input eventually to output layer by process called forward propagation.

No of layers, and no of nuerons in that layers are decided by data scientists.
Weight - Associated with each signal passed. 
		This affects the neuron's decision whether to pass this signal to next layer. 

Step 1: Data enters the network through input layer
Step 2: Pass through hidden layers
Step 3: Data is passed to output layer in the form of prediction.		
Step 4: The loss is calculated (mismatch between predictions and actual)
Step 5: Back propagetion - Weights are adjusted in an iterative way untill actual value 
		are close to prediction value. (reduce the loss)
How to update weight. Two approach-
		Stochastic Gradient Descent
		Batch Gradient Descent -  Avg the outputs and adjust the weights.
