Why is result of below two query different?
1. match(m:Movie) return count(m.title), m.released as Year order by Year
2. match (p:Person) -[]-> (m:Movie) return count(m.title), m.released as Year order by Year

Query 1
```

**Explanation**:  
- This query matches all nodes with the label `Movie`.
- The `COUNT(m.title)` aggregates all movies grouped by their `m.released` property (Year).
- The result contains a single row for each unique release year (`m.released`), and all movies are included in the count.

---

Query 2  

**Explanation**:  
- This query matches all `Movie` nodes, but **only those that are connected to a `Person` node** via any relationship (`-[]->`).
- `COUNT(m.title)` aggregates only the movies that have relationships with at least one `Person` node.
- Movies without a relationship to a `Person` are **excluded** from the results.
- The grouping and ordering are still based on the `m.released` property.
