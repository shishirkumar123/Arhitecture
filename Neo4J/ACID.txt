Neo4j fully supports ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure reliable and predictable data operations. Here's how Neo4j achieves each ACID property:
1. Atomicity
Either all changes are applied, or none are.
Neo4J use a write-ahead log (WAL). Before any changes are made to the database,
-------
2. Consistency
 
Transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, 
maintaining all defined rules (constraints, indexes, etc.).

--------------
3. Isolation
 Neo4j uses Read Committed isolation, ensuring:
A transaction only sees changes that were committed before it started.
Uncommitted changes from other transactions are invisible.

-------------
4. Durability
Write-Ahead Log (WAL): Changes are written to the transaction log before being applied to the database.
Sync to Disk: When a transaction is committed, Neo4j ensures the transaction log is synchronized to disk, guaranteeing persistence.
Recovery Mechanism: After a crash or power failure, Neo4j uses the transaction log to restore the database to a consistent state.
