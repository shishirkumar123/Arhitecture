Neo4J vs RDBMS
--------------------
At depth two (friends-of-friends), both the relational database and the graph database
perform well enough for us to consider using them in an online system. Although the
Neo4j query runs in two-thirds the time of the relational one, an end user would
barely notice the difference in milliseconds between the two. By the time we reach
depth three (friend-of-friend-of-friend), however, itâ€™s clear that the relational database
can no longer deal with the query in a reasonable time frame.
