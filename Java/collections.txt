Hashing
	Types linear probe, hasing, double hashing. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YiQITXu_iM]
	Linear probing  - in case of collision, move one down until you find empty.
		e.x draw result of hashing 3, 56,43,12 into a table if the h(x) = x mod 5 
		solution - if mode is 5, then create and array from 0 to 4 then put the values.	

	Open chaining - in case of collition add a node next at the same level(linked list)
		At the end sort all the linked lists.
		Collision is less than linear probe.

	Quadretic probing - in case of collision move in the series of squares(1,4,8,16...)
	Double hasing - If collision happed, use 2nd hashing formula given

Iterable - Interface with a method iterator() that returns iterator.
Topmost collection - Collection interface extends this interface, so every collection is iterable providing iterator method.
This makes them useful to pass as an argument of 'for each' construct. What will happen if you pass something not iterable to 
'for each' construct?

---------------------
Collection
	Operations
		stream();
	Queue(1.5) - 
		Operations
			add - Inserts the specified element into this queue if possible, else throw exception.
			offer - Inserts the specified element into this queue if possible. Dosen't throw exception.
			remove - Retrieves and removes the head of this queue if possible, else throw exception..
			poll - Retrieves and removes the head of this queue if possible. Dosen't throw exception. 
			peek - Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue., 
			
			 
		ConcurrentLinkedQueue(extends AbstractQueue)
			 An unbounded thread-safe {@linkplain Queue queue} based on linked nodes.
 			 This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out).
		BlockingQueue - methods take timeout(long) additionally
					A {@link Queue} that additionally supports operations that wait for
 				 	the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait
 				 	for space to become available in the queue when storing an element.
			BlockingDeque
		Deque - suffix first/last to all methods
			BlockingDeque
			ConcurrentLinkedDeque(AbstractCollection)
				An unbounded concurrent {@linkplain Deque deque} based on linked nodes.
				Concurrent insertion, removal, and access operations execute safely
				across multiple threads.
		
		LinkedList
			

		Transferer - Shared internal API for dual stacks and queues.
			TransferQueue
			TransferStack
	

	
	AbstractCollection(class)
		AbstractList
			ArrayList(List, RandomAccess, Cloneable, Serializable)
			Vector(List, RandomAccess, Cloneable, Serializable)
				Stack
			AbstractSequentialList
				LinkedList(implements List, Deque, Cloneable, Serializable)

	Implementation -
	ArrayLists, Queues, Stacks are generally backed by an array inside. Linked lists are not. 
	Retrival in faster in array based data structure, Addition is faster in linked data strctures.

	When I implemented, I realized -
	Stack need one index, queue might need two. 
	Stacks are important for DFS(Depth first Search)
	Link list, Tree need to have a head node to start.
	Tree traversal - When to terminate? May be count the number of time you visited the head node. 
		For binary tree it is 2.
	Both Arrays and HashMaps are key value but HashMap keys are hashed. E
		ffectiveness on hashing relates to how often collision happens.
	Graphs - have edges. Tree is specialized graph with one direction.
	Binary search tree - efficient for search. Left is less than right.
		Disadvantage - can be unbalanced. Go for red-black tree.
