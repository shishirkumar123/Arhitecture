Callable and Future
CompletableFuture[supplyAsync... thenApply]

If I have five futures generated after collable finished its task. How can I ensure futures sequence?

CyclicBarrier vs CountdownLatch 

CountdownLatch 
 A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until
 * a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.

CyclicBarrier 
 A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to all wait for
 * each other to reach a common barrier point.  CyclicBarriers are
 * useful in programs involving a fixed sized party of threads that
 * must occasionally wait for each other. The barrier is called
 * <em>cyclic</em> because it can be re-used after the waiting threads
 * are released.

CyclicBarrier takes an (optional) Runnable task which is run once the common barrier condition is met.
For simple use cases - services starting etc... a CountdownLatch is fine.
